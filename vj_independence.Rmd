## Summary of Dataset and Purpose

We have approximately 170 samples per sequencing batch, and for each sample we have 260 counts, one for each of the unique combinations of V and J primers. The primers have different amplification rates, which we need to characterize. In order to do this most accurately, we need to determine if the forward (V) primer and the reverse (J) primer act independently to influence spike amplification, or if their interaction is important as well.  

Two different PCR batches comprise our sequencing batch. There may be a difference in amplification biases based on these batches as well. In addition, samples were diluted by varying degrees prior to sequencing, and we need to determine if that had an influence.  

### Variables

1. Independent variables
    + Forward (V) primer identity - 20 total
    + Reverse (J) primer identity - 13 total
    + PCR batch identity - 2 total
    + Tape Station dilution factor  
  
  
2. Dependent variable
    + Spike Count  


Each sample has an individual file containing the 260 counts. These need to be combined into a single data frame prior to the analysis.

```{r}
read.data <- function(count.dir){
  
  # Read in files and sort by sample number
  all.counts <- list.files(count.dir)
  all.counts <- all.counts[order(as.numeric(gsub(".*_S|.assembled.*", '',
                                                 all.counts)))]

  # Read in first file to start aggregate data frame
  count.df <- read.table(file.path(count.dir, all.counts[1]), sep =',', header = T)
  count.df <- count.df[,3:5]

  # Comine spike counts for all files into 1 data frame
    # Columns are samples
    # Rows are spikes
  for (i in 2:length(all.counts)){
    curr.df <- read.table(file.path(count.dir, all.counts[i]), sep = ',', 
                          header = T)
    count.df <- cbind(count.df, curr.df$spike.count)
  }   #   for i in 2:length(new.counts)
  colnames(count.df) <- c("V", "J", seq(1:length(all.counts)))

#head(count.df[,1:10], n = 20)

  # Collapse data frame to 1 count column
  melt.count.df <- melt(count.df, id.vars = c("V", "J"))

  # Add pseudo-variable of V/J combos
  melt.count.df$combos <- paste(melt.count.df$V, melt.count.df$J, sep = '')

  # Take log2 of count values due to geometric distribution
  log2.melt.count.df <- melt.count.df
  log2.melt.count.df$value <- log2(melt.count.df$value + 1)
  
  # Divide all values by upper quartile as another normalization method
  norm.melt.count.df <- melt.count.df
  norm.melt.count.df$value <- norm.melt.count.df$value /
                            summary(norm.melt.count.df$value)[5]
  
  # V is all V segments, repeated for each J for each sample
  # J is all J segments, repeated same as V
  # Variable corresponds to sample number
  # Value is log2 of count

  return(list("original" = count.df, "melt" = melt.count.df, 
              "log2" = log2.melt.count.df, "third.q" = norm.melt.count.df))
} # read.data(count.df)

DNA150826 <- read.data("~/Desktop/OHSU/tcr_spike/data/vj_counts/DNA150826/")

```


## Linear Regression Model

We want to create a linear regression model in order to test the interaction effect between V and J primers on spike counts. First we'll show an additive model, then a multiplicative model.

```{r}
make.models <- function(batch){
  ### Using Log2 Data
  # Additive
  log2.add.lm <- lm(value ~ V + J, batch$log2)
  log2.add.adj.r2 <- round(summary(log2.add.lm)$adj.r.squared, digits = 4)
  print(paste("Log2 Additive R^2:", log2.add.adj.r2, sep = ' '))
  # Multiplicative
  log2.mult.lm <- lm(value ~ V * J, batch$log2)
  log2.mult.adj.r2 <- round(summary(log2.mult.lm)$adj.r.squared, digits = 4)
  print(paste("Log2 Multiplicative R^2:", log2.mult.adj.r2, sep = ' '))

  
  ### Using Third Quartile data
  # Additive
  third.q.add.lm <- lm(value ~ V + J, batch$third.q)
  third.q.add.adj.r2 <- round(summary(third.q.add.lm)$adj.r.squared, digits = 4)
  print(paste("Third Quartile Additive R^2:", third.q.add.adj.r2, sep = ' '))

  # Multiplicative
  third.q.mult.lm <- lm(value ~ V * J, batch$third.q)
  third.q.mult.adj.r2 <- round(summary(third.q.mult.lm)$adj.r.squared, digits = 4)
  print(paste("Third Quartile Multiplicative R^2:", third.q.mult.adj.r2, sep = ' '))

  
  return(list("log2.add" = log2.add.lm, "log2.add.r2" = log2.add.adj.r2,
         "log2.mult" = log2.mult.lm, "log2.mult.r2" = log2.mult.adj.r2,
         "third.q.add" = third.q.add.lm, "third.q.add.r2" = third.q.add.adj.r2,
         "third.q.mult" = third.q.add.lm, "third.q.mult.r2" = third.q.mult.adj.r2))
} # make.models(batch)

DNA150826.models <- make.models(DNA150826)
DNA160107.models <- make.models(DNA160107)
```

We can see that the multiplicative model explains more variation than the additive. Now we should look at specific V/J pairs to see if there are any specific combinations that are contributing to this increase.

```{r}
steps <- function(batch){
  per.norm.method <- function(batch.method){
    print(deparse(substitute(batch.method)))
    # Null
    null <- lm(value ~ 1, data = batch.method)
    # Full
    full <- lm(value ~ ., data = batch.method)
    
    # Step forward
    print("Forward: ")
    forward <- step(null, scope = list(lower = null, upper = full),
                    direction = "forward")
    forward.summ <- summary(forward)
    print("Backward: ")
    backward <- step(full, scope = list(lower = null, upper = full),
                     direction = "backward")
    backward.summ <- summary(backward)
    print("Both: ")
    both <- step(full, scope = list(lower = null, upper = full),
                 direction = "both")
    both.summ <- summary(both)
    
    return(list("forward" = forward, "for.summary" = forward.summ,
           "backward" = backward, "back.summary" = backward.summ,
           "both" = both, "both.summary" = both.summ))
  } # per.norm.method(batch.method)
  
  batch.log2 <- per.norm.method(batch$log2)
  batch.third.q <- per.norm.method(batch$third.q)
  
  return(list("log2" = batch.log2,
              "third.quartile" = batch.third.q))
} # steps(batch)

DNA150826.steps <- steps(DNA150826)
DNA160107.steps <- steps(DNA160107)
```

Here is a different step function attempt:
```{r}
# Need to rearrange the data frame
# First transform, then create new column with rowsums
#primer.names <- paste(count.df$V, count.df$J, sep = '')

#new.count <- cbind(primer.names,
#                   count.df[,3:169], stringsAsFactors = F)
#new.count <- as.data.frame(t(new.count), stringsAsFactors = F)
#new.count <- new.count[c(2:168),]
#new.count <- apply(new.count, c(1,2), function(x) as.numeric(x))
#count.total <- apply(new.count, 1, sum)
#colnames(new.count) <- primer.names
#new.count <- cbind("total" = count.total, new.count)
#new.count <- data.frame(new.count)

#test.lm <- lm(total ~ ., new.count)

# This doesn't work either...
```


Also going to do a chi squared test. Need to format the data so that we have V's as rows and J's as columns

```{r}
# Need to create a 20 x 13 matrix of V and J counts for chi-squared test
# This empty matrix will be populated by counts
vs <- unique(DNA150826$original$V)
js <- unique(DNA150826$original$J)
v.j.df <- data.frame(matrix(nrow = length(vs), ncol = length(js)))
rownames(v.j.df) <- vs
colnames(v.j.df) <- js

# We have two options for running the chi-squared. We can sum the counts of all of the samples and do one chi-squared, or we can do 170 chi-squareds, one for each sample.

# Variance and standard deviation of each of the 260 spikes
#spike.var <- apply(subset.count, 1, var)
#spike.sd <- apply(subset.count, 1, sd)

# This is for the second option - 170 individual chi-squared tests:
# Run Chi-squared on each individually and extract p value
chi.sq.ps <- NULL
log.chi.sq.ps <- NULL
for (i in 3:length(names(DNA150826$original))){
  curr.df <- DNA150826$original[,c(1:2,i)]
  curr.vj <- populate.vj.df(curr.df, v.j.df)
  log.curr.vj <- log2(curr.vj + 1)
  curr.chi <- chisq.test(curr.vj, correct = F)
  curr.log.chi <- chisq.test(log.curr.vj, correct = F)
  curr.log.p <- curr.log.chi$p.value
  curr.p <- curr.chi$p.value
  chi.sq.ps <- c(chi.sq.ps, curr.p) 
  log.chi.sq.ps <- c(log.chi.sq.ps, curr.log.p)
}  # for
# Returns a vector of p-values for the chi-squared tests. They're all zero, which means that the null hypothesis of independence of primers is rejected in favor of dependent primers.


# Second option: Run chi-squared for the sum of all of the counts.
# We want to scale the counts within samples due to the high variation between samples.
# Extract counts only
# Rows are spikes, columns are samples
subset.count <- DNA150826$original[,3:169]


# Extract column totals - this is a sum of all 260 spike counts for a given sample
sum.of.samples <- apply(subset.count, 2, sum)

# Divide each cell in a sample by its sum
# Since the sum is a vector of length(samples) and our data frame is structured as columns = length(samples), we need to apply over each row, dividing by the entire vector.
scaled.counts <- apply(subset.count, 1, function(x) x / sum.of.samples)
# Rows are now samples and columns are spikes...
rownames(scaled.counts) <- seq(1:167)
colnames(scaled.counts) <- paste(DNA150826$original$V, DNA150826$original$J, sep = '')

# Variance and Standard Deviation of scaled counts
scaled.spike.var <- apply(scaled.counts, 2, var)
scaled.spike.sd <- apply(scaled.counts, 2, sd)

# Now that we've scaled each of the counts, we want to sum each row so that we get a total count for each of the 260 spikes, from all 170 samples. Remember, we need 260 values to populate our 20x13 chi-squared matrix.
# Sum each row
count.sums.by.sample <- apply(DNA150826$original[,3:169], 1, sum)

# Recombine with names for population
count.sums.by.sample <- cbind(DNA150826$original[,1:2], count.sums.by.sample)


# Call function
v.j.df <- populate.vj.df(count.sums.by.sample, v.j.df)



# Now use the 20 x 13 matrix to run a chi-squared
scaled.chi <- chisq.test(v.j.df, correct = F)

# We get a p-value of 2.2 e -16, which tells us we should reject the null hypothesis that primers are independent, in favor of the alternative that they are dependent.
